This is just documenting some hiccups I hit along the way with Modular's stack.

## Tooling Issues

### Mising LSP Server
When installing with uv, the `mojo-lsp-server` does not get installed.
And we have no easy way to install it...so just stuck without lsp.

### Formatting not running
`uv run mojo format` does not work in github ci, but works locally.
hits:
```
/home/runner/work/alpha-max-zero/alpha-max-zero/.venv/bin/mojo: error: unable to resolve Mojo formatter in PATH
```

### Formatting not working
Some reason, we don't seem able to format `out self`
```
error: cannot format src/alpha_max_zero/kernels/games/tic_tac_toe.mojo: Cannot parse: 20:20:     fn __init__(out self):

Oh no! ðŸ’¥ ðŸ’” ðŸ’¥
3 files left unchanged, 1 file failed to reformat.
```

### Can't run mojo tests from uv
```

```

For now just gonna test everything through python

## Graph API Issues

### Pyright complains about max graph types
example errors:
```
/Users/bren077s/Projects/alpha-max-zero/src/alpha_max_zero/game.py:9:6 - error: Stub file not found for "max.graph" (reportMissingTypeStubs)
/Users/bren077s/Projects/alpha-max-zero/src/alpha_max_zero/kernels.py:5:6 - error: Stub file not found for "max.driver" (reportMissingTypeStubs)
Type of "custom" is "(name: str, device: DeviceRef, values: Sequence[Value[Unknown]], out_types: Sequence[Type[Unknown]], parameters: Mapping[str, bool | int | str | DType] | None = None) -> list[Value[Unknown]]" (reportUnknownMemberType)
/Users/bren077s/Projects/alpha-max-zero/tests/test_tic_tac_toe.py
```

### Opaque types and values are not public

For this project opaque types are needed.
They are still labeled as private, so pyright complains about them.
I feel like at this point they should be official even if we eventually want to deprecate them.
